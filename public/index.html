              through academic studies and practical applications.
              My journey began with an internship at "Tesodev", where
              I discovered my passion for backend development.
              This experience was not only enjoyable but also played
              a significant role in shaping my interest in backend technologies.
            <p/>
            <p class="justified-text">
              My interest in user-facing technology led me to dive into front-end development,

              Later, I completed my second internship at a company called "Büyük Savunma ve Yazılılım Teknolojileri".

              technologies. I gained a deep understanding of the fundamentals of AI, including
              hands-on experience with frameworks like TensorFlow. Additionally, I contributed to
              two AI-driven projects by performing data labeling tasks, which were crucial for
              training and validating machine learning models. My work helped enhance the

              Currently, motivated by the desire to explore various aspects of software engineering,
              I became interested in learning Swift and started developing my own app.
